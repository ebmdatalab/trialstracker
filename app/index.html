<section id="introduction">
<p class="lead">Trials registered on <a href="http://clinicaltrials.gov">ClinicalTrials.gov</a> should share results on the site shortly after completing, or publish in a journal. But many organisations <a href="https://www.statnews.com/2015/12/13/clinical-trials-investigation/">fail to report the results of clinical trials</a>. We think <a href="#whyitmatters">this should change</a>. Explore our data (last updated October 2016) to see the universities, government bodies and pharmaceutical companies that aren't sharing their clinical trial results.</p>

<section id="explanation">

<p class="about about-first" id="whyitmatters"><strong>Why it matters</strong>: Clinical trials are the best way we have of testing whether a medicine is safe and effective. They can involve thousands of people, patients and healthy volunteers, and take years to complete. But trials with negative results are twice as likely to remain unreported as those with positive results. This means that patients and doctors don't have the full information about the benefits and risks of treatments. We believe all clinical trials, past and present, should be reported in full. <a href="http://www.alltrials.net/">Read more on AllTrials.net</a> and <a href="http://www.alltrials.net/petition/">sign the petition</a>.</p>

<p class="about" id="methodology"><strong>Our methodology</strong>: We regularly <a href="https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/resources/download">download details of all trials registered on ClinicalTrials.gov</a>. We include all interventional trials completed between Jan 2006 and two years ago, except for Phase 0/1 trials and those that have made a formal request to delay results. Next, we look for <a href="https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/about-site/results">summary results on ClinicalTrials.gov</a>, or linked results on PubMed. Our table includes only sponsors with more than 30 trials: to see all sponsors, <a href='https://github.com/ebmdatalab/trialstracker'>download the full dataset</a>. We understand this method isn't perfect. However, we feel that researchers have a clear obligation to ensure that their results are published, and discoverable. If they have failed to post summary results, or to ensure the trial ID is in their PubMed entry, then their results will be listed here as missing. See <a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/5-2629/v1">our paper</a> for full details.</p>

<p class="about"><strong>How to improve your score</strong>: Hello trial sponsors! Want to improve your score? Simply <a href="https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/manage-recs/how-report#StepsForSubmittingResults">post summary results on ClinicalTrials.gov</a>, or ask your journal to add the trial's NCT ID to the PubMed entry for published results. You should see the data update shortly.</p>
