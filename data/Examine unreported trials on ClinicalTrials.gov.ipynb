    "# Finding trials registered on ClinicalTrials.gov that do not have reported results\n",
    "\n",
    "Reporting of clinical trial results became mandatory for many trials in 2008. However [this paper](http://www.bmj.com/content/352/bmj.i637) and [this investigation](https://www.statnews.com/2015/12/13/clinical-trials-investigation/) both find that substantial numbers of clinical trials have not reported results, even for those trials where the FDAAA has made reporting mandatory.\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook examines how many trials on ClinicalTrials.gov have had their results publicly reported. We have a broader definition of a trial that should report its results than the FDAAA. We count a trial as eligible for our analysis if:\n",
    "\n",
    "- it has overall status of 'Completed'\n",
    "- it has a study type of 'Interventional' \n",
    "- its completion date was after 1 Jan 2006, but is more than 24 months ago\n",
    "- it is phase 2 or later (or its phase is N/A, ie it's a trial of a device or a behavioural intervention)\n",
    "- it has no results disposition date (i.e. no application to delay results has been filed).\n",
    "\n",
    "We then classify it as overdue if it has no summary results attached on ClinicalTrials.gov, and no results on PubMed that are linked by NCT ID (see below). \n",
    "\n",
    "This is substantially broader than FDAAA, which covers only US-based trials of FDA-approved drugs. However, we think all trials should report their results, not just US-based trials, or FDA-approved drugs. In addition, FDAAA requires results to be reported within 12 months of copmletion, and we allow 24 months.\n",
    "\n",
    "ClinicalTrials.gov supplies notes on [how to find studies with results](https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/help/how-find/find-study-results) and [results in general](https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/about-site/results)."
